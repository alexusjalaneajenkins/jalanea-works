## What Is Jalanea Works?

Jalanea Works is a job search platform designed to help people **save time** when applying for jobs and **work efficiently**. It's for people who want to "spray and pray with more intentionality."

Our mission is simple: **get people's foot in the door**—whether that's a survival job, a bridge job, or a career.

---

## The Philosophy

We care about **practicality**.

When a user signs up, we gather career data to understand:
- **Who** they are
- **What** they want
- **Why** they want it
- **When** they can go for it
- **Where** they can go for it

What we provide is **THE HOW**—efficiency and planning.

## The 4 Components of Job Hunting

Users focus on four key areas when job hunting. Jalanea Works supports all of them.

### 1. Preparation & Self-Assessment

**Knowing Yourself**
- Define your skills, experience, values, and career goals
- Core skills: time management, financial literacy, communication
- Research: understand your industry, desired roles, and company values

### 2. Application Materials

**Resume**

- Use keywords
- Optimize for Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS)

**Cover Letter/Extension**

**Portfolio/Work Samples**
- Showcase your abilities with relevant projects

**References**

### 3. Job Search Strategy

**Targeted Search**

## How Jalanea Works... Works

### Step 1: Create a Master Resume

A Master Resume contains everything about the user:
- Experience
- Education
- Credentials
- Skills
- Projects
- Etc.

This is the foundation. Everything flows from here.

### Step 2: Self-Assessment via Onboarding

Users pick what kind of jobs they want to pursue:

| Job Type | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Survival Job** | No experience required, provides training, low pay. Examples: retail, customer service, food service |
| **Bridge Job** | Some experience required, certificate or degree needed. Transitional role between stages |
| **Career Job** | Degree required, 3-5 years experience. Long-term professional role |

### Step 3: See What You Qualify For

We analyze the user's Master Resume against job listings using ATS matching.

We don't just show matches—we **build bridges**:
> "Hey, you're at 50% match, but if you do XYZ you can be at 85%."

### Step 4: Pre-Screening

Before diving deep into a job, users get a **pre-screening** that tells them:
- What this job is about upfront
- Whether it's worth their time

If interested, they can generate a **Job Pocket**.

## Job Pockets

A Job Pocket is an AI-generated briefing that prepares users to apply for a specific job. There are **3 types**, each tailored to different job-hunting modes.

Getting a survival job requires appearing capable but not overqualified.

## Cost Philosophy

**Code it ourselves if possible. Use AI only when necessary.**

We minimize AI costs per job pocket by:
- Building deterministic logic for anything that doesn't need AI
- Using AI only for personalization and generation
- Keeping quality high while costs stay low

---

## The Education Hub

Not everyone knows the basics. We break things down.

For each concept (Resume, Cover Letter, Interview, etc.), users learn:
- **Definition** — What is it?
- **Purpose** — Why does it matter?
- **Components** — What are the parts?
- **Types & Subtypes** — What variations exist?

---

## AI Coach

An AI assistant that helps users with real questions:

**Survival Mode Questions:**
> "I applied to two jobs at once. One has better pay but the other responded first. What do I do if I accept the lower-paying one first?"

**Career Mode Questions:**
> "How do I negotiate a salary? I'm anxious."

The coach adapts to the user's current job-hunting mode.

---

## Calendar & Scheduling

We learn about the user's real schedule and help them plan realistically.

**The Calendar helps users:**
- Figure out how often they can actually apply for jobs
- Block time for specific tasks from their job pockets
- Schedule activities like:
  - Crafting resume
  - Writing cover letters
  - Networking outreach
  - Interview prep

---

## CoPilot (Chrome Extension)

CoPilot is a **Chrome extension** that autofills redundant information on job applications.

**What it does:**
- Automatically fills in repetitive fields (name, email, phone, address, etc.)
- Saves time on applications that ask the same questions over and over
- Works across major job boards and company career pages

**Availability:**
- Desktop only (Chrome browser)
- Requires **Starter tier or higher**

**Why it matters:**
- Job applications are tedious and repetitive
- Users waste hours re-entering the same info
- CoPilot lets users focus on the parts that matter (tailoring resumes, writing cover letters)

---

## Tasks & Microtasks

Users get a to-do list tied to their job pockets.

**How it works:**
1. User gets a task for the day (e.g., "Work on your resume")
2. If they can't complete it by 6pm, they receive an email
3. The email contains a **microtask** that takes only 2-5 minutes
4. This keeps momentum going even on busy days

**Why we do this:**
- People lose motivation when they fall behind
- Small wins keep users moving forward
- 2 minutes is better than 0 minutes

---

## Community (Mission)

A portion of subscription revenue supports Valencia College students through:
- Emergency aid
- Textbooks
- Career resources
- Technology access
- Transportation

This section exists but isn't a core user feature—it's about our mission.

---

## Subscription Tiers

4 tiers designed around job-hunting modes:

| Tier | Price | Who It's For |
|------|-------|--------------|
| **Essential** | $15/mo | People in Survival Mode |
| **Starter** | $25/mo | People between Survival and Bridge Mode |
| **Professional** | $50/mo | People between Bridge and Career Mode |

Each tier unlocks more features, more AI messages, and more job pocket credits.
